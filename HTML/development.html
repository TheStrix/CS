<h2><font face="URW Chancery L" color="#FF4081">Building</font></h3>
<font color="#ffffff"><p>To port Android to a new device, we need to work on tree major components.</p>
<ol><li><u>Device tree</u></li>
<p>The major configuration part for a device is done here. As the name itself points, it is device-specific; means, every device have it's own config setup. Many examples of device tree can be found on Google's Android source git(<a href="https://android.googlesource.com/">here</a>)</p>
Location:android/device/*vendor*/*device*/<br><br>
<li><u>Kernel tree</u></li>
<p>This contains the Linux kernel source. It is setup according to the device's chipset config. That is, devices with same chipset can use the same kernel source!</p>
Location:android/*vendor*/*device*/ or android/*vendor*/*chipset*/<br><br>
<li><u>Vendor tree</u></li>
<p>This contains the library files needed my Android OS. These lib files(.so) are located in /system/lib & /system/vendor/lib on our phone running Android.</p>
Location:android/vendor/*vendor*/*device*/</ol><br><br>
